Another Negro youth and a white youth were shot but not seriously wounded in separate incidents.
Four whites, including a honeymooning couple from Chicago, were injured by stones while driving through the neighborhood of the bombing.
Fourteen Negroes were injured in the explosion.
The four girls killed in the blast had just heard Mrs. Ella C. Demand, their teacher, complete the Sunday school lesson for the day.
Some law-enforcement officials said the bombing might be linked to the second anniversary today of Federal agents' ill-fated assault on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex., an operation that ended in a fire that killed about 80 people, including many children.
In the case of the trade center, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, charged with being the mastermind behind the bombing, entered the United States under an assumed name, recruited local supporters to carry out the detail work and then fled the country within hours of the blast, the authorities say.
Dozens of persons were injured when the bomb went off in the church, which held 400 Negroes at the time, including 80 children.
Blast Kills Four Children.
The Negro youth killed by police was Johnny Robinson, 16.
The bombing was the 21st in Birmingham in eight years, and the first to kill.
The bombing last month of the Pearl Continental Hotel, which killed 11 people, appeared to be a last straw for many here.
The death toll was likely to rise because over 100 people were wounded, with several in critical condition, Sukhera said.



The Associated Press reported that among the injured in subsequent shooting were a white man injured by a Negro.
